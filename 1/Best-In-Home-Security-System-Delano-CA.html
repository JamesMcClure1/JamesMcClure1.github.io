During testing, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adjusted to account for animals, too.

Therefore, each homeowner has to consider their own danger tolerance, however it's generally worth purchasing a real home security system that offers solid assurance.</p>

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera.

DVRs also require that the linked cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to deteriorate.</p>
