<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
