<p>The NVR removes these issues, due to the fact that it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

(We think this is a more valuable feature if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where cars often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's great that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Web cam.</p>

<p>Another important subject to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The exact same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
