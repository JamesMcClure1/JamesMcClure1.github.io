It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even recognize people you have actually identified (after a learning period).

We must keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based upon available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
