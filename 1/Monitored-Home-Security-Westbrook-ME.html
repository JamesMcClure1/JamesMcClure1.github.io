The Wyze Camera can also catch video to the cloud, but the complimentary account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That implies the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to record once again, which implies you might be missing a lot. Wyze's recently launched Total Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 per month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, with no spaces in between.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
