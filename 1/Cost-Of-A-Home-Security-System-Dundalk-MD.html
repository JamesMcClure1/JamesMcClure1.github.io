<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much suffices. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more comprehensive the video image.

Surveillance cameras are also made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.
