<p>This awesome wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout testing, we found it was basic to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly setting off when movement was spotted. We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we tested and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>
