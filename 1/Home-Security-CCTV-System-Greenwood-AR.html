We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape up to 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With basic wise home gadgets like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for would-be package thieves or talk to visitors who drop in.</p>
