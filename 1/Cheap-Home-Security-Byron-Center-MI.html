<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over long distances.

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for further wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera independently, typically via 110VAC power.</p>
