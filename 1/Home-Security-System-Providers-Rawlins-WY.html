<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a regular camera image. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the truth, which implies that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and use up a great deal of recording storage area.
