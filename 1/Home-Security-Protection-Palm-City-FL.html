<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to save and the length of time you prepare to keep taped video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage as soon as you reach the system's capability, but if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>

<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in areas where they are believed to be most effective, which generally includes highly populated towns, city centers, parking lot, or various other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008).
