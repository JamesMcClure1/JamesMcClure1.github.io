<p>Just purchased a bullet ip system and absolutely enjoy it. Terrific clearness. I wanted to establish viewing on my cellular phone however had a couple concerns that the tech responded to with ease. I Would definitely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for instance. However, those functions come at a relatively steep price: $5 per month ($50 per year) for the very first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 per month ($100 each year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 each year) for one month of video history.
