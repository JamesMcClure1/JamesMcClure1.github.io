When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function.

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
