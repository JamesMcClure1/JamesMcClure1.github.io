'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge sibling? The Corporates? Or bothering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side.
