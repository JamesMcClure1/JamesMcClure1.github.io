<p>This cool smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we discovered it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was discovered. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly.
