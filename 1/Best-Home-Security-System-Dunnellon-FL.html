<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to carry out that.
