<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand name doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it says deserves $1,300.

ADT utilizes an independent distributor design involving third-party dealers. The dealerships identify which equipment to use. Costs for systems differ.
