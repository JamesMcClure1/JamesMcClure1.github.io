Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by.
