'Who owns that camera anyway'? Huge bro? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom might not do. They could peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing viewing outside a window it might be a crime, yet the exact same individual might position a surveillance camera then from another location see an individual within the personal privacy of their home.
