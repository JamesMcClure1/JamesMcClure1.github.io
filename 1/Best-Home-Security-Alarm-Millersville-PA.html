Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of getting rid of expensive false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it immediately switch off the heating unit. You can immediately make the smart lights turn on to scare away prospective intruders if the motion sensing units are triggered.</p>
