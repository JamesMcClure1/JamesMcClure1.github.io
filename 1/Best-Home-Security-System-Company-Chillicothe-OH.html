Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by.
