Try to find a design that offers a high resolution (1080p), a broad angle lens (140 to 180 degrees), a night vision variety up to 25 feet, and inexpensive cloud storage for recorded video.

<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in locations where they are thought to be most reliable, which usually includes highly inhabited towns, town hall, car parks, or various other high-crime areas (Welsh and Farrington 2008).
