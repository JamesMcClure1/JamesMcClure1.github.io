<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft.

If you're concerned about break-ins or keeping shipments safe, a security camera with motion signals might be the best fit.</p>
<p>Nationwide Security Corporation has extensive experience with design, installation, service and monitoring of intrusion alarm in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Google Nest is not known for being cheap. The Nest Secure system will set you back around $400 for a starter kit.
