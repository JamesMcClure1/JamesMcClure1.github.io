<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. ADT also has more industry experience and more monitoring centers than SimpliSafe.

Home alarm systems monitored with a conventional landline do not require power to work. Even if you run out power for days, the system must still be able to call for help. If somebody cuts the phone line, however, you will not be able to use the system to call for help.</p>
<p>Nearly all outdoor security cameras are equipped with a motion sensing unit that will set off the camera to record video when motion is identified. The sensing unit can also initiate a push alert to your phone when activity is taking place, and some will likewise produce an email alert. For an extra layer of security, try to find a camera with sound detection that can let you know if someone is out there even if they run out variety of the camera lens and the motion sensor. Fair warning: You'll probably need to modify the sound sensitivity settings to prevent notifies from barking pets, loud cars and trucks, and other random noises.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, generally through 110VAC power.</p>
