<p>Discover how to design, develop, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase staff member safety and decrease crime. The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensor to be sensitive, with awful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and poor battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was faulty, therefore we might revisit this review. Fundamentally, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of footage to the cloud. The large face of the camera gives you an impressive field of view, and the picture you get is of good quality (you can alter the resolution; the better it gets, the more data you'll use to save it to the cloud.) To see that video footage, you can use an app on your phone or a web browser link on your computer.</p>
