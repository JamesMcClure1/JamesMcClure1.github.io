Not only is the Arlo quick to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a good stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Just a couple decades earlier, the home security industry was controlled by a couple of huge names using expensive, rigid plans with little flexibility and unfriendly, long-lasting contracts.
