Another location where Arlo excels is customer support. After long-lasting testing this camera given that we initially made it a choice in 2016, we noticed that our Arlo Q began projecting a pink tint, which seems to be a continuous problem for some owners. We contacted customer support, which offered a free replacement system-- despite the fact that the service warranty had long considering that expired.</p>
