<h3>Best Home Surveillance in North Salt Lake UT</h3>

<p>Smart Sensors - Sound an alarm whenever protected windows and doors are opened and can also be used to secure medicine cabinets, weapon cabinets, or the door to a kid's bedroom. Night vision: Most break-ins happen after dark, so this feature is nearly as important as motion detection. Technically, most home security cameras support infrared LED lighting, versus true night vision based upon image augmentation or thermal vision. Be that as it may, some camera's will change to night vision immediately in low-light conditions, while others enable you to tailor when and how it must be activated.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and once again in client reviews, and it provides a crisp image as much as 32 feet. And despite the fact that the app and software are simple to work with, it's a little bit of a disappointment that you can't integrate this camera with any wise home hubs or gizmos. A lot of clever cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but few make things as easy as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives easier and Hive's ecosystem lives up to that. It's all the function without any aggravation.</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural convergence of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single user interface provides extra information that may never ever have actually been possible in the past, such as notification of a staff member, by name and identification number, entering the structure. An image of that worker exists on screen for confirmation (confirming it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating happens.</p>

Constant recording: A lot of cameras separate recordings into smaller sized, more workable clips.

With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic.
