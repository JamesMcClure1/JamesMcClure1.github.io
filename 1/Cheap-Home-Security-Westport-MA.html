A few designs utilize batteries, making positioning more flexible, but this needs other compromises, which we highlight in the Competitors section. Wi-Fi coverage likewise impacts where you place a camera: If you wish to put a camera in a spot that does not get a good Wi-Fi signal, think about updating your router or adding an extender or repeater.
