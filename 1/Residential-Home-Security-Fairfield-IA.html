<p>The NVR removes these problems, because it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
