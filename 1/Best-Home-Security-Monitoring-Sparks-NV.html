<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
