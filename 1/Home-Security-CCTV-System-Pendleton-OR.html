<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the whole community. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response hinges on a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to keep and how long you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage space rapidly.
