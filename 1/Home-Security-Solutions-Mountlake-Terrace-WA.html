It also features two days of free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can pack in clips of approximately 3 minutes. However, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second gaps in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control panel and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is recording.
