<p>Most home security systems involve Do It Yourself installation of surveillance equipment, so I make certain that that's an easy process. If a home security company just uses professional installation, I observe the process and make certain that the rate isn't too high. Expert home security installation tends to skew upwards of $100, but it's actually your preference whether it's worth its hefty price tag.

<h3>Best Home Security Camera in Oregon</h3>
<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>Cameras that tape large areas of the public are broad in scope, taping everything and everyone within their reach. These cameras record everyone similarly: the public setting about their day-to-day activities, and bad guys who likely shield or blend themselves in to avoid being taped or found. To obstruct criminal activities in procedure, images and video are most helpful when the camera is discriminating and concentrated on activities of interest.</p>
