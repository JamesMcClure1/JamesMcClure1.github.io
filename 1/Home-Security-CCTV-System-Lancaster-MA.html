Nevertheless, you do require to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have key fobs and additional sensing units, too.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
