<p>The NVR removes these issues, due to the fact that it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
