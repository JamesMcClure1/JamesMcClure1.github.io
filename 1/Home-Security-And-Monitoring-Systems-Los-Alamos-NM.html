The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and watch it later on.

This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional electrical wiring.

This action combined with an electrical current (generally at 12V DC) enables an alarm control panel to identify a fault on that zone or circuit. These kind of sensors are very common and are found either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can typically be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
