Hard disk storage is safe, secure, and convenient, with lots of systems offering expansion and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll need to manually remove to transfer the information?
