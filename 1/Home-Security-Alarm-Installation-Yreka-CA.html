Operators could also start calling a list of contact number offered by the client to get in touch with someone to go look at the protected premises. Some zones may activate a call to the local heating oil company to go examine the system, or a call to the owner with details of which space may be getting flooded. Some alarm systems are tied to video surveillance systems so that current video of the intrusion area can be immediately shown on a remote monitor, not to mention tape-recorded.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader area and therefore offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
