<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
