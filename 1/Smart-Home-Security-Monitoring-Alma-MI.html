<p>On the surface, these two camera categories may appear comparable, though if you were able to see inside, the differences end up being unique and apparent.

Because they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality elements that can adapt and catch outstanding low light video, commercial cameras surpass their more affordable cousins.</p>
