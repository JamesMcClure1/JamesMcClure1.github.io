Larger systems that use full-house protection with professional monitoring are the most pricey options. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most cost effective option.</p>

<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
