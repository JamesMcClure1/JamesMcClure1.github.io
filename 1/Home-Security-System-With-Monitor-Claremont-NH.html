If you're searching for night vision cameras that provide the brightest and best night view, opt for models that take advantage of infrared (IR) innovation.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
