<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping hotels, others, and centers. A few of our preferred suppliers enable you to Do It Yourself your alarm system installation, while others send a professional to do the job. Professional installation permits a home security professional to examine your home's security requirements and inform you on how to best utilize your system. The disadvantage is that expert installation typically involves an additional cost.

<p>For most commercial CCTV systems, structured cabling run throughout the walls, connecting your security cameras to the server or NVR, will be an important part.

What good is a surveillance camera that just works preferably in perfect conditions like intense sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in particular scenarios such as baby-sitter cameras or signing in on an animal, though when seeking to gather proof of a criminal activity they frequently come up short.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something triggers your alarm but you're in a meeting with a vendor and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service suggests you don't get alerted up until the next day?
