<p>This cool clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During testing, we discovered it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly activating when motion was detected. We love that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly.
