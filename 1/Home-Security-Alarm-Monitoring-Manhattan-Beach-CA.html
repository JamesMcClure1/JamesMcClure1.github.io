As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "understanding that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "people might find out to be mindful about the periodicals and books they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers.
