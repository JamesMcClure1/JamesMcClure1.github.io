<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by.
