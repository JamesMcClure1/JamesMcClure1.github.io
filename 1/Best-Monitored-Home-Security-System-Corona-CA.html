<p>The loudest of the clever alarm systems we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at alerting anyone in your home and those close-by that there's a problem. Throughout screening, the siren fasted to sound when any of the sensors were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to account for family pets, too. The alarm is simply one of 2 we checked that includes an external siren, and we're impressed that it likewise comes with a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, even more dissuading anybody from attempting to break in to your property. We evaluated Somfy's more costly system, which came with a wifi security camera, but more inexpensive packages are also readily available.

Then, you need to make that call yourself. It's a big difference, and a professionally monitored system is essentially more secure than a self-monitored or unmonitored one.</p>
