If you want to go beyond security cameras and choose a whole alarm system, our Best Home Security Systems review review will show you all the best choices. When expertly installed, it's actually the clever aspect that defines the Vivint Smart Home, with everything integrated into a simple to manage system. The mobile app especially makes it easy to monitor and handle whatever directly from your mobile phone.</p>
<p>You can use a wireless connection to operate your SimpliSafe system, but it doesn't support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, implying you will not have the ability to link it straight to other third-party gadgets like clever locks or automate specific actions in the home. You can, however, use Alexa to equip or deactivate the SimpliSafe system and connect it to your Nest Thermostat to conserve energy based on when you're home or away. But these integrations aren't rather as robust as the abode or Ring systems.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
