When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut.

<h3>Cheap Alarm System La Grange NC 28551</h3>

When a zone has actually been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
