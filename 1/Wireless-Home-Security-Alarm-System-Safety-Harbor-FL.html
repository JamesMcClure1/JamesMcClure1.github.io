<p>Discover how to develop, build, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and minimize criminal offense. The Ring Floodlight Camera combines 2 necessary gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera identifies motion, it turns on its 2 powerful LED beams along with its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Cam also has a loud speaker, so you can speak to whoever remains in front of the camera, and hear their actions.

<p>IP cameras are much higher resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses appointed to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more expertise to setup, and normally cost more than analog cameras. All detectors and sensing units interact with a control board. These are available in two kinds: they can be a physical panel that's installed within the home on a wall, or a virtual panel that's accessible and controlled through smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>Motion sensors offer backup protection in case a burglar manages to get into your home. But they just run when you run out the house.
