<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment this way to make clients stick with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
<p>No false alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less most likely to dispatch the authorities for an incorrect alarm.

On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will call authorities if a homeowner can't validate a false alarm. If  police are gotten in touch with for an incorrect alarm, house owners might need to pay a fine for dispatching cops needlessly.
