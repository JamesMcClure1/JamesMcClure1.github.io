<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the maker's stats because this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest offender for brief battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, however its recording capacity is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>While you're doing your shopping, remember that you can build up a wise security system piece by piece: fitting a network of wireless cameras is no longer the pricey one-and-done overhaul that it used to be. Today's systems can be modified and expanded as needed. There are several alternatives for night vision cameras available. Most of them are cost-efficient yet extremely functional. Go for designs that utilize infrared (IR) innovation if you're looking for night vision cameras that offer the brightest and best night view. Some designs are designed to activate the IR innovation instantly depending upon the light conditions. In addition, guarantee the camera has 100 feet of night vision or more.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
