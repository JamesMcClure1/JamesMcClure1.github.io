In addition, high resolution allows for full-color feeds and extremely comprehensive photos along with night vision abilities. There are a range of CCTV camera types and specifications on the market.</p>

(The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But since a lot of retail theft would not trip an alarm anyhow (an employee slipping some additional money while offering a customer modification, for instance), we think it's more vital to have premium images so you have the proof you need. Which's what Nest provides you.</p>

Commercial cameras surpass their more affordable cousins because they have larger internal video sensors and higher-quality parts that can adjust and catch exceptional low light video.</p>
