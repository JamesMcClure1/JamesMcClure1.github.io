<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on created to resolve the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared essential WPA virtually uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption schemes, any client in the network that knows the secrets can check out all the traffic.</p>
