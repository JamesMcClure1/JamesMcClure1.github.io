Wi-Fi protection also affects where you position a camera: If you want to put a camera in a spot that doesn't get a good Wi-Fi signal, think about updating your router or including an extender or repeater. (For a take a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for The Majority Of People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good general rule that if your mobile phone or laptop gets decent Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to mount the camera, you likely will not have a problem.</p>
