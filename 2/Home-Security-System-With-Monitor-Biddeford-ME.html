<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again respond to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of removing pricey false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically shut off the heater. You can instantly make the smart lights turn on to scare away prospective robbers if the motion sensors are set off.</p>
