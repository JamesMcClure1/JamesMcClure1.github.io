<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
