<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were often missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.

We need to note that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based on available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day.
