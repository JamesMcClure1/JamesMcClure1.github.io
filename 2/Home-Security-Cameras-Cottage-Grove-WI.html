For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies developed their equipment in this manner to make consumers stay with them longer, since switching monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. How did they do it? They positioned five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their most current software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which gadget was the first, and the last to fall, however.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
