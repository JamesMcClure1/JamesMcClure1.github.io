<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but extensive modifications to the character of our public spaces. When people are being viewed by the authorities - or aware they might be viewed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You don't want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals might learn to be cautious about the periodicals and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang drug addicts, members or hookers." Indeed, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people considered to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>

However you can connect the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web web browser.
