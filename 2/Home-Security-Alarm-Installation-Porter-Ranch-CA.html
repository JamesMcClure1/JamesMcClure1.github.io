Then you go into the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi details.

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider location and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
