<p>so state you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a gun so I suggest to have actually cameras built in to a house that will be pertected by cameras.

<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet inexpensive systems readily available today. The very first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then relayed over a local area network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
