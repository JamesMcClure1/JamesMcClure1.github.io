This unit is what communicates with all of the security sensors and smart-home parts in your house. Many connect to a home router, however if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, positioning is more versatile. When they open, contact sensors are the very first thing you must buy together with the base station; these connect to windows and doors and will inform you.

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration.
