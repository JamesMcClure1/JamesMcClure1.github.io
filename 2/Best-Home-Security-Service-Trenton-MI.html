<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
