Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, but low signal strength and bad connection are still common complaints. Hardwired systems need very little upkeep, and short of a general power blackout, are more difficult to interfere with.

<p>Unmonitored systems will not offer the same level of protection for your home, either. Even if your system links to your smart device, there are times when you might not remain in a position to do anything about an alarm going off, like when you're on an airplane, in an important conference, or in an area without phone reception.

Integrating the benefits of a security camera and an intercom offers you a wide range of powerful functions to secure your home or business.</p>
