<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the distinction between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to solve information after the fact, which means that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of taping storage space. So much, in reality, that they require about four times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
