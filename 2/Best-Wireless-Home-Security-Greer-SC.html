<p>Video and image feeds have actually shown important for surveillance - but there's room for more performance by utilizing audio. People have 5 senses that jointly permit us to accurately vary our environment. For that reason, it only makes good sense that a security system that engages as numerous senses as possible is more efficient. And because it's not useful to engage touch, taste, and odor remotely, the most effective video surveillance systems combine sight and hearing to boost security coverage.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and again in consumer reviews, and it delivers a crisp photo approximately 32 feet.
