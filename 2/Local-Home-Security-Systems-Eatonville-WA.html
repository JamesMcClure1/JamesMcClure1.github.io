ELERTS is a complimentary mobile phone app that permits citizens who see something suspicious to take an image and quickly send it to public safety officials. For instance, a public transit rider may discover someone behaving suspiciously. Many individuals are messing, texting or surfing with their mobile phones.

Reports from cellphone users can be quickly evaluated and acted upon by Public Safety authorities.</p>
