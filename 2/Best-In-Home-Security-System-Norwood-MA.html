<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
