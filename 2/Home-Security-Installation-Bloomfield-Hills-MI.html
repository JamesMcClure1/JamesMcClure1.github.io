<h3>Wireless Camera System Bloomfield Hills MI 48304</h3>
<p>When your video cameras are installed, you can pick whether your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you select to have your cameras monitored (this is normally provided for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is tape-recorded when an alarm is triggered.

With a lot of DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can prevent any monthly charges if you decide to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, fees will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 per month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. If you devote to a three-year contract, the cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month. Ring's Protect Plus strategy chooses $10 per month and does not need an agreement.</p>
