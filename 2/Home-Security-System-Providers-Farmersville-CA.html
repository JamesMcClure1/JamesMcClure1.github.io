<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
