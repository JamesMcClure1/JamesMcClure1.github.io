<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the specific same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
