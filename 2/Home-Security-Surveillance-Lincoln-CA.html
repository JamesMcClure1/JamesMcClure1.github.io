<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings.

<p>Think about it in this manner, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced video camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars?

What good is a surveillance camera that only works ideally in ideal conditions like bright sunshine?

<p>So what takes place if something activates your alarm however you remain in a meeting with a supplier and you do not get the alert?
