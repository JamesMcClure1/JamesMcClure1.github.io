Throughout testing, we found it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly setting off when motion was found. We enjoy that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive.
