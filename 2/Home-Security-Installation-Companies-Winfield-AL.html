<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before buying.</p>

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal given that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level.
