You could invest a comparable quantity for the best home security system, but they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Sentinel. But, they're the best home security cameras if you're trying to find active monitoring.

We enjoy that the system includes a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is created by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false signals). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have been activated.
