<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system.

IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to buying.</p>
