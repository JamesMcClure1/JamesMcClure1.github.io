<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
