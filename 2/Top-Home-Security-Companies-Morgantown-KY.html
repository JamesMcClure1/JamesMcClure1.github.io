<p>Another crucial topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to comprehend how much is enough. In this short article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The same holds true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
