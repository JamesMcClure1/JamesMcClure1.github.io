Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
