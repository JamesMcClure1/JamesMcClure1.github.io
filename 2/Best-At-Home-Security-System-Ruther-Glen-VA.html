With traditional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and transmitted in analog format for local viewing from one main monitoring area. But that doesn't indicate you can't use analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to take advantage of your existing analog cameras while migrating into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

For instance, if a motion detector journeys in one location, the signal is taped and the central-station monitor alerts the customer. A second alarm signal-- received in a nearby zone within a brief time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor requires to ask for a dispatch instantly. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
