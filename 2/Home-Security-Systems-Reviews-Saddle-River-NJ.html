<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Recommendation: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We must once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of removing costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately turn off the heating systems.
