<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
