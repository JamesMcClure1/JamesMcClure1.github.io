<p>When it pertains to indoor security equipment, ADT, Frontpoint, and Vivint all sell pet-friendly motion detectors.

You can even pair numerous cameras together on the app, if you so dream. Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However considering that a lot of retail theft would not journey an alarm anyway (a worker slipping some extra money while offering a consumer modification, for instance), we think it's more vital to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you need. Which's what Nest offers you.</p>

The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the deck by a licensed electrical expert (who occurs to be my partner).
