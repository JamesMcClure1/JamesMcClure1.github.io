<p>Nurse calling systems typically consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. He can push the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station if a client is having problem. This is a simple switch that is generally open or generally closed.

<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to use too (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve.
