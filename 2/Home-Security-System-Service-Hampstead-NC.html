<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
