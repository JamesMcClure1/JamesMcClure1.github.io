Each home security system we evaluated was then examined throughout these aspects, consisting of cost, features & technology, customer care, equipment. & style, ease of use, installation process and more.

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity prevention developed to prevent both individual and residential or commercial property criminal activity and can be used in location of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send images of a specific area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will reduce crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

For all the benefits of Nest Secure, the quality of customer care is not one of them.
