<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less break-ins throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to police ability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive method to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a normal camera image. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to fix detail after the reality, which means that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays.

A lot, in reality, that they need about four times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape the same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to invest more money.</p>
