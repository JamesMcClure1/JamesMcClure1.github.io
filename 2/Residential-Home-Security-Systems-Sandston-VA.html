Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. However the Secure is pricey, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you do not dedicate to a three-year agreement.</p>
