<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
