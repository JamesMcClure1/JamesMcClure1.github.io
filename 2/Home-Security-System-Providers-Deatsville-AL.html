<p>A wired security system was the very first type of security system that was created for house owners. It should be installed by a professional alarm installation group and, as soon as installed, is hard to move from one place to another.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
