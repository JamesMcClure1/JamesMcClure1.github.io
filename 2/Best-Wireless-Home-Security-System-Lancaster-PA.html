<p>B. This chapter governs burglar alarm systems meant to summon police department personnel, requires registration, evaluation of fees for excessive incorrect burglar alarms, offers treatments for repeat offenders, and supplies an efficient date. While some vestiges of the old market remain, today's property owners exist with a lot more alternatives.
