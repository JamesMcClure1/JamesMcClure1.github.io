Now, many security systems involve a multitude of elements, such as a base station, security camera, entry, motion, and glass break sensing units, a keypad, and crucial fobs, among other elements. But I also appreciate minimalist systems that elements that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some components can make home automation available to you.

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I tested, including clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. But the Secure is pricey, additional sensors are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which does not include emergency alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not devote to a three-year contract.</p>
