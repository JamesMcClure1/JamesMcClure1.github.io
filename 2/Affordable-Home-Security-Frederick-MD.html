<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to aim to make a camera with the most difficult setup understood to male. Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your email address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi info. (You should play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, canines groan, felines squeal, infants weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>

This technology helps eliminate needless signals.</p>
