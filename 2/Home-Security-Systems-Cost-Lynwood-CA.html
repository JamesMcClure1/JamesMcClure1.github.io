<p>We required guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the early morning and to begin the heating system at 5am. The very first guard showed up early so he might look at the whole location and talk with me about my issues. He was expert, very encouraging and considerate. The 2nd guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I showed up in the early morning to get the occasion started, he was likewise expert, considerate and reassuring. We were extremely pleased with your service and I will advise that we get in touch with your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. As soon as after leaving our home in your hands, I didn't stress.</p>
