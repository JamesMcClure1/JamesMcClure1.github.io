<p>Blue by ADT security systems begin around $200 for equipment. You can choose from a predetermined equipment bundle or curate your own setup to match your security needs. Motion Detection: If you're concerned about video storage, check to see if the camera provides motion detection.

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method approximately 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
