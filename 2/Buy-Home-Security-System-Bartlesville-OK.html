Frequently, the simple existence of security cameras can scare away less-motivated intruders. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or harmed by the more identified robbers. If intruders can not see any security cameras, they may also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
