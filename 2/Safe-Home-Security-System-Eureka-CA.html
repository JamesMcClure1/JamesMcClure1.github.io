<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape-record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were typically missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline.

<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to manually stop notices (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off).

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
