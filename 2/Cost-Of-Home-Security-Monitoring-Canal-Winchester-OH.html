<p>TP-Link's Kasa Camera Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that might rival a few of our top picks. It likewise comes with two days of complimentary cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can pack in clips of approximately 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control board and keypads, various sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.

<p>This clever smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During screening, we found it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when movement was spotted. We like that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your home, which can get expensive. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it just monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we tested and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>

With many DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Package, the Ring Alarm Security Package, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can prevent any regular monthly charges if you decide to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, costs will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. If you devote to a three-year contract, the cost of the Nest service drops to $19 monthly. Ring's Protect Plus plan goes for $10 monthly and doesn't need a contract.</p>
