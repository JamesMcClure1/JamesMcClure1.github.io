The camera includes a rolling 2 week of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for additional cloud storage.

Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
