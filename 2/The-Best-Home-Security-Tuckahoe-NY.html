We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over 2 months. Scout is extremely simple to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based internet browsers, and it allows you to control nearly every element of the security system from another location, and it's highly customizable.
