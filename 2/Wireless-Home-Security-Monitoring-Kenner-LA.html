<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
