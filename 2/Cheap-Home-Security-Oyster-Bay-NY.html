<p>Besides resolution, also think about the field of vision. All security cameras have wide-angle lenses, but not all angles are developed equivalent. Depending upon the lens' field of view, it can see in between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a huge variety in terms of the camera's vision cone. If you wish to see a large area, you ought to consider a camera with a really broad field of view. The ability to mechanically tilt the camera and pan is a great property as well.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
