<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
