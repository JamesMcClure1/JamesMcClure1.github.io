<p>A more affordable alternative to monitored systems, unmonitored systems may include much of the very same functions as their monitored counterpart, consisting of sensing units, cameras, and alarms, but they are not observed by a security service, indicating house owners will not be paying the expensive regular monthly costs associated with monitored security systems. Manage your alarm, locks, lights, thermostats, Z-wave devices, and smart home functions when you're on-the-go. You can even contact emergency services from anywhere with our smart-phone-ready monitoring systems.</p>
<p>Unmonitored systems will not provide the same level of protection for your home, either. Even if your system links to your smart device, there are times when you might not remain in a position to do anything about an alarm going off, like when you're on a plane, in an important meeting, or in an area without phone reception. Put simply, security doorbells are just small security cameras - wired or wireless - that consist of a door buzzer and a 2-way intercom in the frame. Integrating the benefits of a security camera and an intercom offers you a vast array of powerful features to secure your home or business.</p>
