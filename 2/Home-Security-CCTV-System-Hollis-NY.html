<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, impermanence and mobility. Occupants, unlike house owners, generally avoid making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other elements can easily be established at different homes in the future, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new elements too. Wireless security plans also allow push-button control of the system and general home automation.

<p>Whether you decide to go with a Do It Yourself system or opt for a professionally installed system, you'll have to pay a yearly or regular monthly cost if you need monitoring, and in many cases, you'll be hit with a month-to-month charge to settle the cost of hardware components. With the majority of Do It Yourself systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can avoid any month-to-month charges if you decide to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, costs will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month. If you dedicate to a three-year agreement, the price of the Nest service drops to $19 per month. Ring's Protect Plus plan goes for $10 each month and does not need an agreement.</p>
