We also experienced above-average connection issues, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting 8 times over two months. Scout is very easy to utilize, specifically if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it enables you to control practically every aspect of the security system from another location, and it's extremely personalized.
