<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors safeguard your security system versus short-term surges that can enter through AC power lines, telephone lines and remote notice zones.

<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to cops ability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund authorities response to alarmed properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to break-in reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
