<p>We needed guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to protect the line tent and building, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to begin the heater at 5am. The first guard arrived early so he might take a look at the whole location and speak to me about my concerns. He was professional, considerate and very comforting. The 2nd guard showed up in the middle of the night and took over. When I arrived in the morning to get the event started, he was likewise professional, comforting and courteous. We were really pleased with your service and I will advise that we get in touch with your company next year for this event. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep.
