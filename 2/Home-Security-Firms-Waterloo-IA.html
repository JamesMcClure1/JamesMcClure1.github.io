<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics since this originates from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest culprit for short battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capability is a bit restricted to recommend as a top choice.</p>
<p>Keypad: A smart device app is a must for use when you're far from home, but you shouldn't have to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it easy to arm and disarm the system. If you already own a Ring video doorbell and want to expand your home security protection, including Ring Alarm makes good sense. When you add other Ring products to Ring Alarm it becomes a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way interaction, and clever lighting. Of course, at that point, the cheap cost ends up being more expensive.</p>
