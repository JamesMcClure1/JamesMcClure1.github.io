<p>The loudest of the clever alarm we checked, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good task at cautioning anyone in your house and those neighboring that there's an issue. During testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we like that the sensitivity of the motion sensor can be gotten used to account for pets, too. The alarm is just one of two we evaluated that consists of an external siren, and we're impressed that it also comes with a dummy siren that can be connected to another external wall, further dissuading anybody from trying to break in to your property.
